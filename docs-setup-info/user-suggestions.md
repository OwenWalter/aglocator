------


- Nikhil Deo: Update request process: User makes change suggestion, then submits. In backend, manager of existing AG and new AG are sent an approve/deny. If both approve, update is pushed.
- Sunit Dadhania: Change font - concerns on readability when all CAPS letters
- Mario Zamora: split TS / non-TS AG's
- Mario Zamora: fix a lot of the TS.GENERAL.AG assignments that should go to non-TS groups (such as Education.e-Learning.AG)
- Mario Zamora: look into wildcards - model after https://connect.ebsco.com/s/article/Searching-with-Wildcards-in-EDS-and-EBSCOhost?language=en_US 
- Andy Foreman: Think about data loading for future - do we split manual entries into a separate table so they are easily preserved? How to best handle re-sync with future updates from source in CSM?
- Andy Foreman: Sirius cheatsheet is still editable. We should revoke permissions on Sirius cheatsheet editors, effectively making Sirius Cheatsheet read-only. (Per Jason Moore - not ready to do this yet as of 3/11/24. Whenever we do, we should check for any changes in Cheatsheet since 3/11/24 and replicate them within AG Locator)
